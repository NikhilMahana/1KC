<h1>One Thousand Contributors Programme</h1>
<br>
</div>

The Technical Education, Community, and Support (TCS) team(s) of the Web3 Foundation are 
launching an off-chain contributor program to support and fund community contributors. 

For contributors, on-chain funding through
[Treasury Proposals](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury#creating-a-treasury-proposal) 
proposals and [Tipping](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury#tipping) are possible ways 
to receiving funding. 

The TCS team is offering another avenue to reward contributions that may encounter difficulties 
in existing funding methods. In particular, the contributors program aims to capture contributions 
in the areas of **Technical Education**, **Community** and **Support**. 

The team believes that this program will foster serious engagement and contribution, while embarking 
on the WEB3 vision.
 
> The 1KC Program will help us build a stronger bond with our community and facilitate the creation 
> of quality content.
